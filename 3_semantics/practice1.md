1. `<div>` and `<span>` are not semantic

2. `<article>` tag is used for self-contained text that can be placed elsewhere and still usable.

3. It would appropriate to replace the `<article>` tag with `<address>` or `<blockquote>`.
```html
<article>
  <blockquote>
    <h1>...</h1>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>...</p>
  </blockquote>
</article>
```

4. `<section>` tag is the best choice for a part of a larger body of work. It is not an `aside`.

5. `<aside>` is meant for comment added for a paragraph.
