JPEG is lossy - possible to compress image down to 10% of original size.

If a JPG file is repeatedly being edited, you can see JPEG artifacts.

JPG can have sizes up to four gigapixel, square images can be up to 65,535 pixels.

A lossy JPG gradient shows color banding.

### PNG
Portable Network Graphics are suitable for CSS background images. The format is high quality alternative to gif format.

The color depth is adjustable - meaning that a PNG can have 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit colors.

Two modes of transparency:
- Single color transparency:
If PNG includes transparent color, then any pixel of that color is transparent.
- Alpha transparency: adds alpha channel to every pixel. The alpha channel adjusts how transparent a pixel with either 256 or 65536 levels of transparency.

### GIF
Graphics Interchange Format has a limited number of colors. GIFs is the lone format that supports animation.

No alpha transparency can be added to GIFs.
